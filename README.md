# Enterprise RAG Foundations

This repository documents my journey into building enterprise-grade
Generative AI systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Focus Areas
** Understanding LLM capabilities and limitations
** Designing safe and reliable RAG architectures
** Clear separation of indexing and retrieval
** Preventing hallucination through grounding and validation

## Current Status
Conceptual foundations complete. Implementation in progress.

## Why This Matters
Modern enterprises require AI systems that are explainable, grounded
in trusted data, and safe to use in production environments.
This repository focuses on building such systems.
