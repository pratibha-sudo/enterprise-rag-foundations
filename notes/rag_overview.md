# RAG Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture where an application
retrieves trusted internal data and constrains a Large Language Model (LLM)
to generate responses grounded only in that data.

## High-Level Flow
User question → retrieval of relevant data → prompt assembly →
LLM explanation → validation → answer with sources.

RAG improves reliability, reduces hallucination, and enables
enterprise-safe use of Gen AI systems.
